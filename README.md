MongoDB Basic Practice Task
Objective: 
Understand the basics of MongoDB, its commands, and apply the knowledge by creating a short document explaining key concepts and a real-world use case. 
Tasks: 
1.	Database & Collection Setup: 
o	Create a new database (e.g., studentDB) 
o	Create a collection (e.g., students) 
2.	Insert Operations: 
o	Insert one document into the students collection. 
o	Insert multiple documents with fields like name, age, course, status. 
3.	Read Operations: 
o	Fetch all documents from the collection. 
o	Use filters to fetch specific data (e.g., students enrolled in “MERN Stack”). 
4.	Update Operations: 
o	Update a single document (e.g., change the status of a student to completed). 
o	Update multiple documents at once. 
5.	Delete Operations: 
o	Delete one document based on a condition. 
o	Delete all documents in the collection (for practice purpose only). 
6.	Query Operators: 
o	Practice using $gt, $lt, $in, $and, $or, $exists in different queries. 
7.	Use Case: 
o	Create a small use case like a Library System or E-Commerce product listing and apply insert, update, and search operations. 
  
Outcome: 
By completing this task, you’ll be able to confidently perform CRUD operations in MongoDB, use query operators, and understand how to structure and access your data efficiently.
